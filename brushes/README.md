This File is part of bLUe software.

Brush presets added to this folder are automatically loaded when bLUe is launched. Any png or jpg image 
can be used as a preset : bLUe resizes the image and only the luminosity channel is used.

A preset represents an horizontal brushstroke (from left to right).
To mimic arbitrary brushstrokes, presets are rotated dynamically according to the mouse move direction.
 
To download free preset images
